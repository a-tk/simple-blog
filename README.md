This simple blog project is for my CS 497 - Enterprise Web Development HW3.

# mvc technology

In this project I wanted to use AngularJS to make a blog using the model view controller
pattern.

So, the entire frontend is an angular app, using bootstrap for styling. 
On the backend, I run a simple NodeJS server, that serves api urls for data persistence.

Data is simple in this app; all posts are stored in a json text file on the server, but yea, it was 
never built to scale for many users.
